## Scaffolding

### Pre-requisites

* Having a modern version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and NPM installed.
* Some of the commands are Unix-based.

### Overview

This branch shows the scaffolding of a [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) project, using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), most of it was done by Hardhat itself.

To get a similar result, you can try running the following commands:

```bash
cd .. && mkdir my-hardhat-project && cd my-hardhat-project
```

```bash
npx hardhat
```

You'll get a prompt, choose the Typescript option, then keep pressing enter until Hardhat generates your files.
