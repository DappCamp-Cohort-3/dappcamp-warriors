# Camp dApp

This repo contains a step by step walkthrough towards a production-ready dApp.

## Repo structure

If you take a look of the existing branches, you'll see that there's multiple numbered branches. They build on top of each other, starting from `0-overview` (the one you're in, right now).
Each branch has its own readme, like this one, with an overview of the progress towards the dApp.

## dApp overview

The goal at DappCamp is that you learn the keys of building a dApp, so this walkthrough includes:

* Building an [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) (non-fungible) token.
* Building an [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) (fungible) token.
* Creating a staking contract (DeFi).
* Testing.
* Deploying contracts.
* Gas optimization.
* Security.
* Interacting with your contracts from the browser.
